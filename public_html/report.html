	    <p><b>Successes</b><br />
		<i>March 3rd, 2013</i><br /><br />
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our successes thus far have centered around our organizational structure. Through the use of outside software components, such as Trello, Google Docs and GitHub, we have been able to provide a central area for process management and design. These tools have allowed us to keep a concrete schedule of tasks to complete for the week (mainly through the use of Trello) and an area to collaborate on these tasks to complete them (mainly through the use of GitHub and Google Docs).</p>

	    <p><b>Problems</b><br />
		<i>March 3rd, 2013</i><br /><br />
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The main problems we have faced throughout our experience thus far have stemmed from miscommunication and scheduling conflicts. The main problem with miscommunication has been not amongst our own team members, but with our partner team. As we were completing our draft of the communications protocol, we ran into a variety of obstacles when attempting to communicate with our partner team. These obstacles were eventually overcome, but the time lost through miscommunication was time we could have spent completing and refining the rest of the post lab deliverables. <br />
		<br />
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our other problem thus far has been merging all of our group members schedules together to generate a weekly schedule that works for all of us. As we begin to optimize our meeting process, we will be able to have fewer meetings and for shorter amounts of time which will mitigate this risk and allow for a better product to be produced.

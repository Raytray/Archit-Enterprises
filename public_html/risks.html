	<h1>Risks</h1>
	<br />
	<p> This page identifies the risks that our project faces. We hope to have this page be comprehensive but we realize that not all risk analysis will ever be complete. So in a sense, this page is, and will always be, incomplete.</p>
	<hr />
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Missing Parts</b></li>
	</ul>
	<p>We hope to mitigate this risk by designing early on and knowing what parts we will need in advanced. However we realize that this might not always be possible, and thus this risk will has been minimized but will always be persistent for long as the project is in the build phase. This has also been addressed by the customer.</p>
	<hr />
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Schedule and Milestone Backlog</b></li>
	</ul>
	<p>We came to this risk by realizing that we may not always complete milestones on time. We hope to mitigate this risk by staying on top of each assigned task. We also have included a small buffer time to each task in order to allow and grow a safe zone that we can safely go overschedule. We are also prescheduling multiple meetings to ensure we are on task and completing the milestones as schedule.</p>
	<hr />
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Short Staffed</b></li>
	</ul>
	<p>We realize that our group is a 4 man team compared to the typical 5 man team of the other groups. And we feel that as a result, if we were to lose a team member, it would impact us much more for this project. To mitigate this risk, we plan to work closely with the other team and ensure that we are working on a similar schedule, to the point where if we did lose a team member, we could possibly make up the loss with assistent from the partner team.</p>
	<hr />
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Verification/Validation</b></li>
	</ul>
	<p>We find that there is always a risk in building the correct system, and the system correctly. We hope to mitigate this by prototyping as accurately to our final product and to iterate our prototype often. We will hope to verify our system with the partner group at least once a week. This would allow for a rapid iteration schedule and enable us to keep up with our schedule.</p>
